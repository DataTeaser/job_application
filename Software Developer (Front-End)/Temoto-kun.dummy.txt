Greetings!

I was referred to by someone in your company. Having acquired sufficient technical skills and a year and a half of previous work experience, I would like to apply as a Software Developer (Front-End).

I am knowledgeable in popular CSS frameworks such as Foundation and Bootstrap, as well as libraries such as jQuery, AngularJS, and React. I have tried building Web applications with D3.js. I am also well-acquainted of building hybrid mobile apps, mobile apps built from Web technologies, such as Ionic + Cordova. I have been brushing up PHP through Laravel and WordPress as well.

I am able to work with groups, yet I prefer working alone by being indicated the correct and preferred steps in solving problems. Nevertheless, meeting new peers will be an exciting experience for me.

You can contact me at allan.crisostomo@pup.edu.ph.

Thank you very much.

ALLAN V. CRISOSTOMO
